Project made quickly using .net console applications, the whole point of it is to loop until someone stops the application the pomodoro timer ( 25 minutes of work and a 5 minute break ) with sounds signalizing the start of the 25 minutes timer and another sound signalizing the start of the 5 minute break. 

It was really fun to code and will have its own real world use as I will start using it to monitor my team developing my other projects to ensure I won't burn myself out.
